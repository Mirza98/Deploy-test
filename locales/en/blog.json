      "content": "City Council of the City of Zenica supported our Preliminary Design for the expansion of Training Center of the Football Association BiH in Zenica (Phase II).\nWe are proud that we had the opportunity to be a part of this beautiful story from the very beginning of building this Center (Phase I) and especially now that we have the opportunity to work on the continuation of the project (Phase II).\nThe Football / Soccer Training Center is located on Kamberovića Ravna (Crkvičko brdo) in Zenica.\nIt was officially opened in 2013 and it is the first complex of its kind in BiH, intended for the training purposes and playing matches.\nThe construction of the complex is planned in two phases.\nThe built field and objects in Phase I showed that this is a high quality project that provided excellent conditions for the training process, provided the necessary peace to all our teams, is actively used more than 300 days a year and which significantly contributes to the development of football. These are the reasons why the need to expand the center was considered.\nPhase II anticipates capacity expansion at the existing Training Center: building of two new large football fields measuring 105x68 meters, a new facility with all necessary hotel facilities (4-star hotel rating) that would increase the hotel capacity of the existing building.\nAs we were innovative in 2010 and designed something that had not been designed in BiH before, now something new again - SOLAR CARPORTS\nThe construction of Solar Carports, a covered parking lot with solar panels with a total area of ​​1,316 m2, is also planned on the site. This would be the first parking lot done in this way in BiH.\nSolar Carports would be a contribution to the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency of the City of Zenica as well as the Action Plan for the Green City of Zenica (GCAP)",

      "content": "Here is what a poet, professor of English and director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library, Betty Sue Flowers, has to say about it. Professor Flowers deals with solving the creative blockage of her students, who give up writing because the sentences they write seem bad to them.\n\"What's the hardest part of writing?\" she asked on the first day of class.\n\"Getting started,\" someone offers, groaning.\n\"No, it's not getting started,\" a voice in the back of the room corrects. \"It's keeping on once you do get started. I can always write a sentence or two-but then I get stuck.\"\n\"Why?\" she asked.\n\"I don't know. I am writing along, and all of a sudden I realize how awful it is, and I tear it up. Then I start over again, and after two sentences, the same thing happens.\"\n\"Let me suggest something which might help,\" she said. Turning to the board, she wrote four words: \"Madman,\" \"Architect,\" \"Carpenter,\" \"Judge.\"\nThen she explained:\n\"What happens when you get stuck is that two competing energies are locked horn to horn pushing against each other. One is the energy of what I'll call your 'Madman.' He is full of ideas, writes crazily and perhaps rather sloppily, gets carried away by enthusiasm or anger, and if really let loose, could turn out ten pages an hour.\n The second is a kind of critical energy-what I'll call the 'Judge.' He's been educated and knows asentence fragment when he sees one. He peers over your shoulder and says, 'That's trash!' with such authority that the Madman loses his crazy confidence and shrivels up. You know the Judge is right-after all, he speaks with the voice of your most imperious English teacher. But for all his sharpness of eye, he can't create anything.\nSo you're stuck. Every time your Madman starts to write, your Judge pounces on him.\nWhatever joy there is in the writing process can come only when the energies are flowing freely-when you're not stuck.\nAnd the trick to not getting stuck involves separating the energies. If you let the Judge with his intimidating carping come too close to the Madman and his playful, creative energies, the ideas which form the basis for your writing will never have a chance to surface. But you can't simply throw out the Judge. The subjective personal outpourings of your Madman must be balanced by the objective, impersonal vision of the educated critic within you.Writing is not just self-expression; it is communication as well.\nSo start by promising your Judge that you'll get around to asking his opinion, but not now. And then let the Madman's energy flow. Find what interests you in the topic, the question or emotion that it raises in you, and respond as you might to a friend-or an enemy. Talk on paper, page after page, and don't stop to judge or correct sentences. Then, after a set amount of time, perhaps, stop and gather the paper up and wait a day.\nThe next morning, ask your 'Architect' to enter. She will read the wild scribblings saved from the night before and pick out maybe a tenth of the jottings as relevant or interesting. Her job is simply to select large chunks of material and to arrange them in a pattern that might form an argument. The thinking here is large, organizational, paragraph level thinking-the Architect doesn't worry about sentence structure.\nNo, the sentence structure is left for the 'Carpenter' who enters after the essay has been hewn into large chunks of related ideas. The Carpenter nails these ideas together in a logical sequence, making sure each sentence is clearly written, contributes to the argument of the paragraph, and leads logically and gracefully to the next sentence. When the Carpenter finishes, the essay should be smooth and watertight.\nAnd then the Judge comes around to inspect. Punctuation, spelling, grammar, tone-all the details which result in a polished essay become important only in this last stage. These details are not the concern of the Madman who's come up with them, or the Architect who's organized them, or the Carpenter who's nailed the ideas together, sentence by sentence. Save details for the Judge.\"\nConclusion: Let the Madman to write and then let Architect, Carpenter and Judge to work on text - but only after the ink on screen dries.",
